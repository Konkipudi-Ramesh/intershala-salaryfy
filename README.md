# Salaryfy.io â€” Frontend Demo (Ready-to-run)

This archive contains a ready-to-run React + Vite + Tailwind project named `salaryfy`.
Unzip, install dependencies and run the dev server. The project includes a working index.html,
Tailwind/PostCSS configs, Vite config, and a sample hero SVG so the page will render without missing assets.

## Run locally
```bash
# unzip (if needed) and enter folder
cd salaryfy_final

# install deps
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Notes:
- package.json contains "type": "module" so PostCSS/Tailwind ESM configs won't cause warnings.
- Everything required for a basic demo is included. Edit `src/components` for changes.
